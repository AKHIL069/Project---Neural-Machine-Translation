# Project---Neural-Machine-Translation
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is the task of using artificial neural network models for translation from one language to the other.

# Introduction :
1. The NMT model generally consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which
a decoder generates a translation.
2. This problem can be thought as a prediction problem, where given a sequence of words in source language as input,
task is to predict the output sequence of words in target language.
3. The dataset comes from http://www.manythings.org/anki/, where you may nd tab delimited bilingual sentence pairs in
different les based on the source and target language of your choice.
4. For this project, you need to use French - English language pairs just to evaluate the projects uniformly for all students.
